      "message": "I\u0027m not sure if external mic will always work better than built-in mic in camera recording case. When capturing video from back camera, if audio is mainly from the phone user, it makes sense that the headset\u0027s mic will perform better than built-in mic. However, if the user is aim at capturing audio around, I\u0027d not expect headset\u0027s mic perform better than built-in mic.\n\nEric, could you also comment on this change?",

      "message": "This is currently controlled by a UI in the camera app to let the user decide if they want to use the wired headset or not . this is similar to call audio routing selection to speakerphone or not. We prefer the default to be the build in mic even if a wired headset is connect and let the user override the default with the camera app UI",

      "message": "Yes, thanks for your reply.\nwhen connect headset, users always feedbck the sound is lower when camera recording for sound is recorded by builtin mic.\nRefer to the habits of recorder APP and voice call, sound should default be recorded by external devices.  link voice call default select headset, not give selection to user.\n\nAnother scenarioï¼Œ when users use lapel type wireless microphone to live, or caemra recoding use selfie stick, the builtin sound is low for distance.\n\nso we thinks the design it better, thanks.",
