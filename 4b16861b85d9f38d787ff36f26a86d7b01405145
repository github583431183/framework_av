      "message": "some sts tests include Codec2BufferUtils.h and since they don\u0027t depend on libnativewindow_headers and libarect_headers, build fails.\n\nUnfortunately those repositories are not in aosp. So can\u0027t update them to include these two as dependencies. Need to see how to fix the dependency.\n\nPatchset 16 which used uint32_t instead of an enum was able to build correctly.\nAdding an enum, requires adding \u003candroid/hardware_buffer.h\u003e and this leads to current issue in treehugger.",
