A character can consist of multiple bytes (which is why mBuffer is allocated at size (255*3+1)), so you might end up copying substantially less characters than needed.\nYou should instead work this into the loop below, similar to what\u0027s done for set(uint16_t*) below, and calculate the actual number of characters and bytes as you\u0027re parsing the input string.",
