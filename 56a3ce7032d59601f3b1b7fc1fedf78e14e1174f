      "message": "You are right. make libmediacodecservice or make mediacodec does not work with this CL. It works with Android.mk since build/make finds it using first-makefiles-under. I assume Soong does not do that, only parses referenced .bp files.\n\nWhats the way to fix the abs path in local_include_dirs? Have the libs export their headers?",
