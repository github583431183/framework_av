      "message": "The status of this patch is it allows for the AAP E-AC3-JOC passthrough case to get closer to working, however there is still a problem where for the output stream, a non direct stream successfully opens for the E-AC3-JOC request on the remote submix HAL *without* needing to go through the SpdifStreamOut encoder, because (it seems) due to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/refs/changes/50/2886950/1/media/libaudiohal/impl/Hal2AidlMapper.cpp#715 introduced in https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/av/+/2886950 . When this happens, the pipeline fails because raw E-AC3-JOC data is written to the remote submix HAL without IEC 61937 encapsulation.\n\nI\u0027m going to look into the effect reverting https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/av/+/2886950 has on the remote submix E-AC3-JOC enablement.",
