CL in C2SoftAVCEnc can be cherry-picked to aosp/master (as that wasn\u0027t the security fix) and will work without changes to libavc and then this CL can be rebased on that.\nOr this CL can be merged in internal branches for now and cherry-picked to aosp later.\nPlease let me know if I should CP that C2SoftAVCEnc.cpp change to aosp/master.",
