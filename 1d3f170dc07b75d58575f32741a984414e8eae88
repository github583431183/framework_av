      "message": "Switching from shared_libs to runtime_libs will change the order that libraries are loaded. shared_libs will add them as DT_NEEDED, so they will be loaded before the binary that declares them is loaded, and then when dlopen is called, they will already be cached. runtime_libs is an Android build concept. We are basically declaring \"we will use these at runtime\". If runtime_libs doesn\u0027t work, then it would be considered a bug in the fuzzer infrastructure, because it should take this as a hint and install them. Though - it is a shame that the author of the fuzzer infrastructure would probably have to know about this and manually handle it, it would be just the specific nature of the implementation.",
