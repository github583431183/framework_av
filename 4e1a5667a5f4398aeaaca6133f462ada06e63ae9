(as the codec just has one security model).\n\nThis seems opposite of what I would expect, e.g. regular codec can play any content, where as there may be codecs that can only play trusted-only content, or content that the app dev marked as suitable to play using a memory-safe codec.\n\nThat said, that logic is not testable until we have a trusted-only model codec, so perhaps this is just temporary.",
