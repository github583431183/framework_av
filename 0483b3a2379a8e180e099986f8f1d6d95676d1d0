This includes selectTrack() and getTrackFormat() which contains the CSD. \nTime taken to get CSD is equivalent to time to create format which can be ignored because it is so small as to be not worth considering.

CSD extraction time is hence not measured separately.\n\nAs for CSD bytes, we are taking them into account to make the benchmark stats(number of bytes extracted column in the stats sheet) consistent across NDK and SDK, since the CSD bytes are being counted in NDK.",
