      "message": "if I understand the bug correctly, if i were to configure in the original with these smaller ht/width/framerate values, i\u0027m not getting the correct calculated profile.\n\nlooking at the CTS test line that this is to re-enable: we specify all 3 of those parameters.  To me, that should result in a proper setting of the profile.\n\nthat seems more a problem in how (or when)  we calculate the profile than anything else. Changing the defaults doesn\u0027t feel like the correct answer; it seems to mask the problem rather than fix it.\n\nso I\u0027m going to -1 this for the time being until that\u0027s been answered.",
