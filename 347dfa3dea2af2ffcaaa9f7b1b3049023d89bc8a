      "message": "no. they mean that non-\"Z\" doesn\u0027t necessarily imply local time. it might be that you\u0027re in Asia/Seoul on vacation and your Android device has noticed this via the network, but your camera was set to America/Los_Angeles once when you bought it and doesn\u0027t know where it is right now, so the camera says \"20160106T081700-0800\" but we just ignore the \"-0800\" and assume local time which is actually \"+0900\".\n\nshort of switching to icu4c (or doing this in Java rather than native code), i can\u0027t off the top of my head think of a reasonable way to support that. strptime(3) doesn\u0027t support time zones, and mktime(3) ignores tm_gmtoff. i guess what you\u0027d have to do is use timegm and then manually add/subtract the UTC offset (with wrapping). so since this isn\u0027t a regression i wasn\u0027t volunteering :-)",
