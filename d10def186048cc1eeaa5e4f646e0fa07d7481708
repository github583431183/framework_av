      "message": "the difference in data written (the non-critical metadata) is pretty small, so I am doubtful of the \u0027much faster\u0027 claim.\nthe numbers in this commit -- that it goes from 6+ seconds to just under 2 seconds:  that implies that this non-critical metadata accounted for 4+ seconds of writing time and that seems unlikely.\n\nThe leading \"blocks access to the sdcard for a long time\" is relevant. Pointing more at not being able to do other things/apps rather than that writing the recording takes a long time.\n\nIn that case, I would think that the problem is more that the kernel doesn\u0027t allow other unrelated reads to jump in front of the long line of blocks being written out; with the presumption that the two are unrelated (e.g. not trying to re-read what is in the write queue; which i would expect to have been caught by the in-memory block caching before it gets to any actual io).",
