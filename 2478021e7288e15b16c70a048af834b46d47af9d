      "message": "Hi Kris, this is the fuzzer for MediaAnalyticsService. It is not ready to be merged. \n\nOne problem is that I don\u0027t know a good way to put the fuzzer in a separate location, as I need to include MediaAnalyticsService.cpp and its dependencies directly.\n \nFor the problem of API uses caller uid to determine whether caller is trusted, I just realized I can mock the `IPCThreadState::self()-\u003egetCallingUid()` API, but the problem is that, if we call the API as a trusted user and provide a random input to cause a crash, can it ready be considered as a bug? I\u0027ve emailed the audio guys about this question, but the response may take some time.\n\nAlso, I tried to serialize the input into parcel and then deserialize it just as what binder does, but the deserialize method terminates the fuzzer without causing a crash. Do you have any idea about it?",
