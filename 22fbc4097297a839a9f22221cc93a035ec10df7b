      "message": "Thank you Saurabh for bringing this up.\n\nThe suggested change breaks the expectation for devices that doesn\u0027t support multiple secure codecs. (If a process with same or higher priority holds a codec already, then we shouldn\u0027t be allowed to create another secure codec)\n\nHaving said that, this also doesn\u0027t let user create a codec even when a lower priority process has a codec at the moment. So, there is a bug.\n\nI am proposing a fix that I will share with you soon.",
