      "message": "Hi Girish, thanks for the prompt response. New change (2940313) correctly ensures the calling/requesting client is compared with other clients only. However, I see that we are still stopping comparision after first client with higher priority is found. Do we not want to check all the available clients before we stop the comparision since there can be more than secure 2 clients present in cases like three secure playbacks (2 in Split screen and 1 in PiP window)?",

(If a process with same or higher priority holds a codec already, then we shouldn\u0027t be allowed to create another secure codec)\n\nHaving said that, this also doesn\u0027t let user create a codec even when a lower priority process has a codec at the moment. So, there is a bug.\n\nI am proposing a fix that I will share with you soon.",
