      "message": "Since this function is called only as a deferred action, NuPlayer::processDeferredActions() makes sure this function won\u0027t be called when mFlushingAudio !\u003d NONE || mFlushingVideo !\u003d NONE.\n\nTo help us understand your case, could you provide more details? For example, the calling sequence, NuPlayer state when source returns discontinuity just after reset is performed, etc. Do you mean NuPlayer::performReset() has been called when you say \"when reset is performed\"?",
