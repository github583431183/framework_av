      "message": "marcone: Alternatively, we could define these APIs using `int32_t` in this case to provide an ABI compatible declaration. The problem with that approach is that anyone passing an `off_t` to this API in that case will have that offset silently (assuming they aren\u0027t using -Wconversion, and no one does) truncated to 32-bits, which leads to different run time surprises.\n\nAny opinion? idk how cripple the API is without these two functions.",
