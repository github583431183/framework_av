From the stack, it does not look like it\u0027s because of `AudioHwDevice`. I suspect there could be some caveat with the use of `string_view` in the static map. In the code I suggested as a template I was using `string`.",

It seems that the issue is in the `mInputBufferSizeOrderedDevs` declaration, because code doesn\u0027t pass the comparator in the ctor params. I missed this part while moving the patch from my local AOSP 13 source tree, which I tested on the physical device, to the `main` branch.\n\nHere is the small example confirms that https://godbolt.org/z/4fcxn73sd. Compiler even excludes `Bar::cmp` since nobody uses it.",
