I don\u0027t know how you document functions in Android C++, but the documentation would be something along the lines of:\n\nReturns whether the given file descriptor is opened using a mode which is compatible with  MPEG4Writer.\n\nEDIT: Actually Ray\u0027s comment about having a static Create which does the fd validation is probably better. The documentation and location parts of the comment still help, I believe.",
