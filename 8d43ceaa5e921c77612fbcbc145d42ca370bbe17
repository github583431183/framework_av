Shouldn\u0027t you just stop playing this file?\n\nIf you skip a cluster, you\u0027re potentially skipping intervening video frames.  The frames that follow in the next cluster aren\u0027t necessarily even decodable.\n\nDo you have a specific example of a WebM with a bad cluster, from which you were able to continue playing?",

These elements should be skipped. There is also an invalid element at 451417 that should be skipped until the next valid Cluster is found.\"\n\nI guess it is a rigged test but the requirement is to keep on playing.\nA torrent downloaded to 99% could possibly show the same behaviour but we had some partially downloaded files and those usually triggers the return error below.",
