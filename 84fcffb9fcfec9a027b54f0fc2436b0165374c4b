      "message": "I believe a buffer level estimate is still needed for TRANSFER_SYNC_NOTIF_CALLBACK. Off the top of my head, a simple fix is either we mutex the obtainBuffer in AudioTrackShared (prefer not to given that we want to avoid mutexes in this logic) or we issue a nonblocking request for NOTIF_CALLBACK (with some wait timing done here).  Jean-Michel did the logic for TRANSFER_SYNC_NOTIF_CALLBACK so probably could comment better.\n\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/jni/android_media_AudioTrack.cpp;l\u003d168",
