      "message": "C2 structs support strings using char[] and this has to be the final member of the struct.\n\nFor that you need to move this after allocFlags, and use\n\nint32_t allocFlags;\nchar heapName[];\n\nDEFINE_AND_DESCRIBE_FLEX_C2STRUCT(StoreDmaBufUsage, heapName)\n\nMaking this a flex struct will make C2StoreDmaBufUsageInfo have an m member field of type C2StoreDmaBufUsageStruct instead of inheriting directly from C2StoreDmaBufUsageStruct, which was unfortunately required from C++ standard as the size of a flexible struct is not defined during its definition, unlike a non-flexible struct.",

I\u0027ve not looked into the flex struct yet (and I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve groked the implications of the inheritance point you make), so I\u0027ll see about trying that approach out tomorrow.",
