      "message": "Thanks Ray, I implemented your suggestions. To be sure, I built \"aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-userdebug\":\n\n$ m -j32\n$ mmma frameworks/av\n\n..which is a regular 64+32bit build. When it completes, I see:\n\n$ readelf -a out/target/product/vsoc_x86_64/data/nativetest/ResourceManagerService_test/ResourceManagerService_test  | grep NEEDED\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libbinder.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [liblog.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libmedia.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libutils.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libc++.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libc.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libm.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libdl.so]\n\nWhich is what you wanted to see, I think. The ResourceManagerService_test is built for 32-bit and 64-bit successfully.",
