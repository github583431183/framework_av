      "message": "Arun,\nCame across this CL based on the link in the bug. \n\nJust thought of adding few more observations on the current t-fs-release source tree (hoping that it helps).\n\nmax-input-size passed from the MediaCodec side is taking effect as long as it is greater than component requested size.\nTo verify that, in a local AMediaCodec_* based application, I configured \"max-input-size\" to various values and checked the size of buffer returned in AMediaCodec_getInputBuffer.\n\nBuffer size matches the passed in \"max-input-size\" effect whenever it is greater than component requested size.\n\nIs it possible that in that, when going through the config params, before component reached \"max-input-size\", there was an error and thus it didn\u0027t configure the buffer sizes correctly leading to smaller buffers being allocated?
