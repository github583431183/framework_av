      "message": "i would prefer these lines moved into the if statatement (6347), but more about the fix.\n\nAs I understand it, lines 6345-6346 are intended to slow down the amount of reads to something more manageable.  See internal ag/1231917.\n\nHowever, there may still be a considerable number of frames still left in the read buffer after the read on line 6339.  I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027d compare mPipeSource-\u003eavailableToRead() with framesToRead because that\u0027s comparing the pipe buffer depth with the resampler buffer depth. Rather, I\u0027d prefer the computation for sleepUs to be based on mPipeSource-\u003eavailableToRead(), e.g. using min(sleepFrames, mPipeFramesP2 - mPipeSource-\u003eavailableToRead()) or some such equivalent on line 6346.",
