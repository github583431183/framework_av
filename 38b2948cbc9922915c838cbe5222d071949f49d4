      "message": "it wasn\u0027t explicitly stated in the change that introduced this (https://googleplex-android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/frameworks/av/+/10097992/) but the apparent intention was \"don\u0027t include what you don\u0027t use\" --- the VNDK doesn\u0027t get the one API that uses JNIEnv*, and that API was introduced in API level 30.\n\npersonally i think that kind of thing is a mistake. it just makes callers\u0027 lives harder because now they need to think of two cases with different sets of transitive includes. (personally, i think we should remove the __ANDROID_VNDK__ check here too, but that seemed a bit more off-topic than my strict goal of \"remove manual checks of __ANDROID_API__\"...)",
