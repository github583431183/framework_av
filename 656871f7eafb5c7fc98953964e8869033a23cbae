      "message": "Hi Branden, to give you some context, the reason I have added you in CC is because we have created automated alerts for fuzzers that have performance issues, that will look at this field to identify who to send the alerts to. Also feel free to suggest a mailing list to use instead. Otherwise if you would prefer not to receive these alerts I will go ahead and abandon this change.",
