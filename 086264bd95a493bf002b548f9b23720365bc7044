      "message": "Thanks for the contribution! Unfortunately we\u0027re not heavily investing in `MediaExtractor` at the moment, so I\u0027m afraid we won\u0027t be merging this, because the potential benefits don\u0027t outweigh the risk of introducing regressions and associated maintenance costs.\n\nI would recommend you use the androidx.media3 player (ExoPlayer) and its extractors instead of `MediaExtractor` for nearly all use-cases. These are much more actively maintained, we will accept PRs for them on https://github.com/androidx/media, and they also offer many more possibilities for customization (e.g. you can provide your own `ExtractorsFactory` that sorts extractors with any logic you prefer).",

      "message": "I\u0027m rather confused when you saying you are not heavily investing MediaExtracor. I wonder do you plan to deprecate MediaPlayer and MediaExtractor in the future ? If not, since they are still the default player and extractor in aosp, there are still many customers using them, CTS has hundreds of cases to test them as well. And we find this issue by running MediaFrameworkUnitTest, we can\u0027t just switch to use androidx.media3 to bypass this issue.\nHi Ian, do you have any comments about my confusion ?",
