I don\u0027t remember whether that a failure there means \"nonfunctional jail\" or \"service refuses to start\".\n\nthe good news is that the code that chooses which policy file to load is also in the mainline module, so we have the ability to\ndo something morally equivalent to:\n\nSetUpMiniJail( isBeforeV() ? \"preV.policy\" : mediaswcodec.policy\");",
