The new audio port list should be reloaded with the new device IDs on java side.\nI am curious to see exactly how we end up with this mismatch between native and java.\n\nI also thought that all audio patches referring to a given device where cleared when this device is connected",

      "message": "We do have a SwOutput that can be routed on 2 bus devices (lets call them bus_music and bus_ws). bus_music is always available, whereas bus_ws can be mounted/unmounted.\nWhen starting the platform, a patch is created to ensure bus_music is reachable. Then bus_ws is mounted, and I trigger a play using the right attributes to be routed on the strategy forcing bus_ws. I checks the patch at java layer, all is ok.\nPrevious patch is updated with the new sink, patch id is unchanged.\n\nI umount bus_ws. The Output is not closed since it still support bus_media\n(remember: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/av/+/1863726).\nPatch is still alive with same id.\n\nI mount again bus_ws (so attached again, and a new id is assigned) and trigger a playback. The setOutputDevices detect that SwOutput is routed on same device (bus_ws), thus, does not force the patch update.\nSo, patch is still alive, with same id, but the sink bus_ws is holding the previous id.\nWhen calling listAudioPatch, listAudioPort, AudioManager fails to associate the port id of the patch sink and the port. Thus, I cannot ensure the patch is correctly routed (sink is declared as null). And the track cannot infer it is correctly routed.",

      "message": "Yes, definitely what you proposed is the cleanest solution, we need to close and re-open the SwOutput as it can still be used to reach bus_media (which is available). Otherwise,if playback is triggered for media, it will fail as no output to reach media bus is opened (bug related to this CL:\nhttps://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/av/+/1863726)\nI will try to rework setDeviceConnectionState to do so.",

Note that if it is the primary output (which is our case), if we go for a closeOutput if the output can still be used to reach an available device, mPrimaryOutput will be reset until next bus connection...\nSo, either we go for a setOutputDevices (that lead to restore the still avail device on the concerned output without reset the mPrimaryOutput, as at policy initialization), or we need more code to reassign primary output.",
