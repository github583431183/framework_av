      "message": "This seems dubious to me.\nBy the time the destructor is called, there should be no other references to the object other than \"this\" in current thread.\nSo locking a member field like mShutdownLock should be a no-op.\nI think a better fix is to not call the destructor if there are references still active.\nSometimes we use weak pointers for this.\nCheck out the similar code in AudioTrack.cpp\nfunction AudioTrack::DeathNotifier::binderDied ...\nsee how it promotes a weak pointer, and if that fails, it means there are no more valid references available (object has already been destroyed).",
