      "message": "If this fixes the problem it means we are in a context of an active effects moved to a new effect chain by  AudioFlinger::moveEffectChain_l() because it is the only place where start() is called (we cannot be in  moveAuxEffectToIo() because we are not using aux effects).\nThe normal way to enable an effect is from EffectChain::process_l() if updateState() indicates we started the effect and we should probably also call resetVolume() before starting the effect in this context. But this is more complex as we cannot call the callback with the EffectModule mutex held.\n\nOne option is to set mSetVolumeReentrantTid \u003d gettid(); before and reset it after and call  getCallback()-\u003eresetVolume() in EffectVolume::start_l()",

      "message": "Interesting analysis - perhaps the comment on line 1093 is incorrect.  We need to have the EffectChain::mLock held while calling EffectModule::start() because it may be currently processing.  Simply having the PlaybackThread::mLock is insufficient.\n\nPerhaps we should rearrange the logic here in AudioFlinger::moveEffectChain_l()\n\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/av/services/audioflinger/AudioFlinger.cpp;drc\u003d33223031bc31ca094ca4960cb6cf20ef266834c4;l\u003d3996\n\nto call the EffectModule::start() with the effect chain lock.  With some more modification (i.e. passing the changed effects to the caller, or provide a thunk to do so), we could reenable after all thread locks are released, but that probably is not needed.\n\nTo be honest, I\u0027d like to remove volume control altogether now that we are processing in float.  But that might be a later change.",
