It sounds like it is \"as soon as we start using prebuilts that include this\", maybe with a little flexibility to ensure that we don\u0027t fall victim to a quick \"revert to the previous prebuilts\".\n\nthis probably takes the form of a separate bug.\n\ncan we make it happen in time for V/15?",

      "message": "Ok, so it looks like we don\u0027t have a point in time where we only build the mainline modules from source because we have those other `ap.*a` releases, not just `next`.\n\nAnd `libvintf` won\u0027t allow multiple different modules to declare the same interface.\n\nSo we can include the fragment in `mediaserver` conditionally with product_variables/exclude_vintf_fragments like I added in aosp/3108297.\n\nHowever, that means that we will run into a problem when we finally update the mediaswcodec mainline module prebuilt to include the vintf_fragment. I don\u0027t know how this process is done. Is it possible to update the mainline module prebuilt and add a CL to the same topic to remove the `vintf_fragments` entry on `mediaserver`?",
