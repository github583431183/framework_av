      "message": "Wonsik,\nOne problem I foresee with such an approach is,\nif there is a regression at some point where on devices that currently support 1010102 fail for this format, it would not be detected by the CTS tests.\n\nPatrick,\nRecently the test that is discussed in the bug was updated to check for HDR capabilities \nhttps://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/cts/+/1849015/\nThis fix is also merged in android12-tests-dev.\n\nCan you please try with that updated test once and check if the test still fails on your setup?\nThanks.",

The limitation here really is that our GPU cannot support the format RGBA1010102 and it is why our gralloc HAL rejects the buffer allocation due to buffer usage of BufferUsage::GPU_TEXTURE.  Thanks",
