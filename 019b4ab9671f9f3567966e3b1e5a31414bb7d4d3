      "message": "I used what made sense based on the most common expect use of broadcast mode which is share music listening with friends wearing headsets.\nIf you want to take a look at the default volume curves they are defined here:\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/av/services/audiopolicy/config/audio_policy_volumes.xml?q\u003daudio_policy_volumes\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/av/services/audiopolicy/config/default_volume_tables.xml\n\nFor media, a headset uses the DEFAULT_MEDIA_VOLUME_CURVE whereas a speaker uses the DEFAULT_DEVICE_CATEGORY_SPEAKER_VOLUME_CURVE which are identical by default but OEMs can tweak them. You might find differences on some use cases in the S curve shape or the minimum volume in dB",
