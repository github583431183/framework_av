Or are they out of sync?\n\n@taklee@google.com Could you please clarify what is the expected behavior here? From our discussion I assume `mSenderManager` may not be handling the partial failures correctly, leading to an inconsistency. In any case we shouldn\u0027t rely on `isNewConnection` out param to be consistent with the iterator validity.\n\n\u003e This would only be a problem if registerSender() set isNewConnection to false, when it was previously true on line 283, right?\n\nRight.",
