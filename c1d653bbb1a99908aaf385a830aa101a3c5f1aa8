      "message": "this does not really make sense as written here, as if vsyncsForLastFrame was already 0, we should instead skip the whole VSYNC correction. BTW, it is really hard for me to imagine how mTimeCorrection could be positive if vsyncsForLastFrame was in fact 0.  The better fix would have been to add \u0026\u0026 vsyncsForLastFrame \u003e 0 after line 457.",

      "message": "Both of these could be optimized further, I\u0027m sure. My main concern was eliminating the overflow condition that was triggering the SIGABRT. Since these just are used for logging purposes, I figured the changes with the least impact would be those that limited the FRAME_VSYNCS value, as they would be invalid after an over/underflow anyway.",
