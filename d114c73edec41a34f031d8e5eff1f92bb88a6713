      "message": "Ray,\nSince h.263 base profile supports a limited set of resolutions, we wanted to reduce the number of width/height values that get picked up. \nI feel it is okay to allow 352x96 tests, as the goal is to reduce the number of width/height combinations that are tried rather than to limit it absolutely to only the supported ones.\nIf you prefer to tie width and height together, we can update this.",
