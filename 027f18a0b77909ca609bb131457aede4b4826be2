      "message": "If the primary output is closed, the only mean to reassign it today is using onNewAudioModulesAvailable called from APM#init or from AF on DevicesFactoryHalCallback.\n\nIt was \"easier\" to prevent closing it rather than considering to reassign it each time a setDeviceConnectionState is called.\n\nIf you feel the second solution is better, then I will update the CL to \n\n-put guard everytime the mPrimaryOutput is used with validity check\n-add a check in setDeviceConnectionState to reconnect it.",
