(https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat#KEY_CODECS_STRING)\nBut it is only available in JAVA layer. This code contribution is to add KEY_CODECS_STRING in native layer so that application can set this key-value pair to codec2 component.\nOne specific use case for Dolby is AC-4 decoder gets this info so that it can be configured with different initialize parameters.",
