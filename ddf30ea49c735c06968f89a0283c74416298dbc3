      "message": "it seems we are only need to separate HW vs SW in this part of the code (at least in this CL) that already takes in isHardware. Is there a reason why we want the subtype to distinguish between SW and HW codecs? Being HW vs SW codec could also be a continuum, e.g. fully HW accelerated, mostly HW accelerated, barely HW accelerated. What is the definition of isHardware for RM?",
