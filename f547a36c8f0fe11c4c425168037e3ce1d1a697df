      "message": "Martin,\ncould you please double check or confirm - I believe normally inputBufInfo-\u003emFlags should have the flag set already? maybe this is an issue that when mSawInputEOS\u003dtrue happens, there are other input buffers in the queue and thus the flag is missed? thanks.",

      "message": "If I remember correctly, the issue was that the EOS flag (when called from OMXCodec.cpp) comes on a separate, empty buffer.  Thus, the flags from that buffer actually never turns up in inputBufInfo-\u003emFlags here.\n\nThis fixes using the recordvideo test application (among other things, I\u0027d guess) with this encoder, FWIW.",
