If lowestPriorityPid \u003d\u003d callingPid, lowestPriority *should* be the same as callingPriority, so the logic below will return false anyway.\n\nIs this a racing condition where the process priority changes while this method is executing? Please elaborate the scenario for which this change is necessary.",
