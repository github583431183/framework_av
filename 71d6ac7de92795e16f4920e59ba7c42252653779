      "message": "let\u0027s document which CTS tests show that this is working.\n\ngeneral rule should be that what we document here for the testing is something that another android engineer can reproduce.  so a CTS test is good; a command line test is also good.  but a test that doesn\u0027t exist somewhere within the android tree isn\u0027t a great combination.  Fuzzing is a little different, but we still have the fuzzing sequence over in clusterfuzz/haiku and that will get re-run.  it\u0027d be perfect if we had a nice way to say \"clusterfuzz sequence #47752\" that would go exactly to the relevant test case.",
