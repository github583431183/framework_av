      "message": "We meet an issue when doing path switch between BT and SPKR/HS during Gtalk voice call. In our audio policy it switches the output from BT to audio hardware during the process and I find that the start_output/stop_output are not paired sometimes and cause logic issue, so that I add stop() here to fix that issue. But you explanation is reasonable and I will do more tests to check it again.",
