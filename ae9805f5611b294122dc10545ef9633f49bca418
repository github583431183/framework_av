Would this CL be simpler if we closed and deleted the sideband handle directly after passing it to the native window?\n\ne.g. err \u003d native_window_set_sideband_stream(..., sidebandHandle);\nnative_handle_close(sidebandHandle);\nnative_handle_delete(sidebandHandle);\n\nnative_window should have its own copy of the sideband handle at that point, so we could close/delete our copy.",
