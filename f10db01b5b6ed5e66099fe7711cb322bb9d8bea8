      "message": "Hi Gopalakrishnan:\nWhen integrating nxp media extractor into android s12 , it doesn\u0027t work with MediaAppender because nxp extractor has a unified name \"ImxExtractor\" for all file formats, but MediaAppender requires a name like \"MPEG4Extractor\". Other vendors probably have similar issue. If replace name-checking with mime-checking, this code shall work better, no matter how they name their extractors. Could you take some time to review this change? Thanks in advance.",
