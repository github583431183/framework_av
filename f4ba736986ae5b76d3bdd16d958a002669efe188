      "message": "PS9 changes the approach: see also depends-on patch https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/hardware/interfaces/+/2959146\n\nIn this approach:\n* remote submix AIDL HAL doesn\u0027t advertise new DIRECT/IEC958_NONAUDIO mix ports. It is now consistent with the remote submix HIDL HAL approach which simply adds 192kHz support.\n* retries for opening remote submix AIDL HAL without DIRECT/IEC958_NONAUDIO flags is added to Hal2AidlMapper adapter.\n\nThis results in a overall simpler topic.\n\nUnfortunately, with these changes, the following tests are still failing\n* audiorouting_tests\n* CtsVirtualDevicesTestCases --test-filter\u003d\".*VirtualAudioTest.*\"\n\nHowever, as the introduction of remote submix AIDL direct ports was further complicating the implementation and debug, I think this is overall a better approach and it should hopefully be easier to reason about and fix.",
