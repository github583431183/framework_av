      "message": "Right, this should be the same for all buffers of same request....\nSomehow I thought this loop is iterating thru one request batch.\nWill fix.\n\nThe other feedback from partner: just setting the duration to exposure time is not enough, we might need some extra time for pipeline latency. I am thinking 3 seconds should be more than enough. Any objections?",
