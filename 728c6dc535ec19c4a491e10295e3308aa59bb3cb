      "message": "Thanks Harish, this looks good to me, and makes the Audio Effects code more readable. Adding Mikhail, Eric, and Ricardo to see if they have comments or preferences on the .clang-format.  We might add this to an effects presubmit hook later.",

      "message": "I think the recommended practice in Android is to make .clang-format a symlink to build/soong/scripts/system-clang-format (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/refs/heads/master/scripts/system-clang-format) for converging to the same format. It is mostly the same as this one, however it\u0027s lacking `BinPack*` and `SortIncludes` directives. If these are critical, we can probably add `system-clang-format-3` (there is already format-2) for code like this. Or perhaps bite the bullet and reformat this code.",
