      "message": "I think the recommended practice in Android is to make .clang-format a symlink to build/soong/scripts/system-clang-format (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/refs/heads/master/scripts/system-clang-format) for converging to the same format. It is mostly the same as this one, however it\u0027s lacking `BinPack*` and `SortIncludes` directives. If these are critical, we can probably add `system-clang-format-3` (there is already format-2) for code like this. Or perhaps bite the bullet and reformat this code.",

      "message": "Mikhail,\nI looked at the two formats in build/soong.\nTwo major differences are\n1. SortIncludes - lvm currently requires this to be false (sorting the includes currently results in some build errors)\n2. DerivePointerAlignment/PointerAlignment: Currently most of the code in lvm is using right aligntment (eg: int *a). Both the styles in the folder set DerivePointerAlignment to false and set PointerAlignment to left (int* a).\n\nMaking changes to enable SortIncludes: true may be time consuming for lvm and not sure if it is worth the effort.\nSecond one is more of a style preference and not really a blocker, though Google default style derives pointer alignment based on what is used the most in that file.\n\nAnd regarding the option to create system-clang-format-3 in build/soong, IMHO that kind of defeats the purpose of converging to a common style as each project may keep adding their own variant in that folder. And also because that is in a different repository, it won\u0027t be as easy as making changes to the one in lvm folder.\n\nPlease let me know what should we do on this?",

      "message": "If we are trying to ultimately converge on a standard format, perhaps we should do (2) pointer alignment and skip (1) sort includes in this CL, with our own private .clang-format?   That should be a simple automated change.  I\u0027d prefer to stick to automated changes in this CL.\n\nLater, if we choose to do so, we can fix the includes and unify to the system-clang-format, preferably on a different CL given that might take some manual code changes.

I think it\u0027s OK to leave a local clang-format consisting of two sections: one copied from the system-wide format (ideally with no modifications), and below it--project-specific directives with justifications.
