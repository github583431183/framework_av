It needs to meet SLO in postsubmit on all configured targets.\n\nAnalyzer Description: Validates test modules added to presubmit in TEST_MAPPING.\nOwner: android-testing-at-scale@google.com\n\nTest module \"AmrwbDecoderTest\" is being added to presubmit. It needs to meet SLO in postsubmit on all configured targets.\n\nBranch: main, Target: aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-trunk_staging-userdebug\nERROR: No data found for this config.\nDoes not meet SLO. Please consult go/test-mapping-slo-guide\n\nFAIL: This test module does not meet SLO and is not ready to be in presubmit.\n\n\n\n----\n\nthe action item from all of this is that the tests should go into \u0027postsubmit\u0027\nfor a while (probably several weeks) to build up a track record showing their stability.  Once they have that track record, then they can be moved to presubmit.\n\nthis will hold true for all of the changes in this CL.",
