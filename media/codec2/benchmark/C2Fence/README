Benchmarks for C2Fence implementation.

PipeMicroBench: Implementing C2Fence-ish object using pipe() syscall
Waiting 1 million times took 1299420 usec on the below tests.

EventfdMicroBench: Implementing C2Fence-ish object using eventfd() syscall
Waiting 1 million times took 1299940 usec on the below tests.

Both of implementations took almost same time. And overhead for polling
an event may around 1 micro second, which is negligible.
Test was done on a panther device.(2023-09-29)
