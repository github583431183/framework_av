It\u0027s particularly concerning because it can lead to potential ODR violations in some cases.\n\nThat said, can you share specific instances here where this diagnostic is being issued for this file? Maybe they would prefer to update those instances to be inline (or change how they are declaring/defining those constants instead).",
