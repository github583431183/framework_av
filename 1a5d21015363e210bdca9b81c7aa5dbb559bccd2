      "message": "the description says \"EOS can be either 0 or previous\". this lets the EOS frame be anything.\n\ni think a better expression is something like:\n\nif (!isSampleMetadataValid()) {\n    if (!eos) return -EINVAL;\n    if (timestamp !\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 timestamp !\u003d last timestamp) return -EINVAL;\n}\n\nI also think this code doesn\u0027t handle the case where\nthe buffer contains both data AND an eos indication.\nSo I think the fix is more involved than what is presented here -- in either\nthe proposed patch or in my rephrasing.",
