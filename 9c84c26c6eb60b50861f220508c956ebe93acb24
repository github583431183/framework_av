      "message": "Thanks Wonsik for sharing this. To be honest, I didn\u0027t know the existence of those test cases (and was wondering why we have only MediaFormat test cases under frameworks/av/media/ndk/test/)\nSome part of this has been covered by the cts/tests/media/jni, but in here I have added 2 different approaches:\n- directly feeding input samples from the extractor (which above cts does) when codec input buffers are available.\n- An external entity feeding input samples to codec.\n\nThey are pretty much the same, except for who decides when to feed the decoder.",
