      "message": "I think the fence is a key part of this API. Perhaps:\n\nBlocking fetch for linear block. Obtains a linear writeable block of given\n|capacity| and |usage|, or a |fence|. If a block can be successfully obtained,\nthe block is stored in |block|, |fence| is set to a null-fence and C2_OK is returned. If a block cannot be temporarily obtained, |block| is set to nullptr,\na waitable fence is stored into |fence| and C2_BLOCKING is returned. Otherwise,\n|block| is set to nullptr and |fence| is set to a null-fence. The waitable fence\nis signaled when the temporary restriction on fetch is lifted, e.g. more memory\nis available to fetch because some memory or prior blocks were released.",
