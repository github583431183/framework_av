Completely separating the 192khz mixport and device port in the HIDL remote submix audio HAL, and associated routing, and removing 192khz from the non direct mix ports. When I do this, the failed tests start being \"IGNORED\", and registering DD+JOC audio policy in the loopback test fails.\n\n2. Just removing 192khz from the non direct mix ports, having a separate 192kHz only mix port, but leaving the device ports to include 8kHz-192kHz sample rates, and declaring routing allowed between those mixports and device ports. When that is done, there are patch mismatch errors because 192kHz mixports are trying to be patched from 8kHz device ports. Not sure why, but it fails.\n\nThere are other options I\u0027ve tried, but tests all failed because of sample rate failures.\n\nOh, the other thing is, even in the passing result before this CL, there are patch requests to remote submix hal to patch 192kHz device port to 48kHz mix port, and these actually go through without error, and I think this is what later causes mismatches for later open stream requests. That is a clue of what is causing these problems. I suspect there are issues with config matching / device port / mix port handling, but this is masked because requests only ever seem to be made at 48kHz, but what is needed in the E-AC3-JOC case is a new sample rate (192kHz).",
